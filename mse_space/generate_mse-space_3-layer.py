#I have found that the only reasonable way to generate this data is to run multiple iterations of the same
#script on different nodes at the same time. This can be accomplished by uncommenting one of the 'thicks'
#lines at a time for each run. Also the thicknesses in each array can be altered to look at the sets of
#evens, evens+0.5nm, odds, odds+0.5nm, for a total of 20 parallel iterations of the same code. I suggest to
#rename the output folder for each thickness type (o,e,o+0.5,e+0.5) to give a unique identifier when used
#in combination with the s variable in the output file name.I have only provided this single code beacuse 
#the alterations are minor between runs.
